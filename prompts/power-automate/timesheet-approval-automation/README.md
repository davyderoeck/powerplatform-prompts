# Timesheet Tracking Automation

## Description

This prompt helps with automating your employee timesheet approval process. When a new timesheet record is added in your defined system, it sends an approval to the submitter's manager.  If the manager approves, it starts another approval for HR approval. Notifications are sent to the submitter along the way.
